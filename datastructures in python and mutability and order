ex:student=["RITU","LIKITHA"]
print(student[0]) -ritu
print(student[1])  -likitha #it is called lists.

MUTABILITY- it is nothing but when we are able to replace an element in given no.of elements is called mutable else immutable.

ex : student=["ritu","sudha","likitha","rupa"]
student[3]="pallavi"
print(student)
output- ["ritu","sudha","likitha","pallavi"]   #right here the RUPA is get replaced by the pallavi sothat lists comes under mutable.

ex : name="ritu"
name[1]="e"
print(name)         # when it comes to strings it character "I"  is not replaced by"E" so that it is immutable.

ORDER-    both string and list are both comes into order when you ask for specific letter in string or element in list it pops itout.
 ex : student=["ritu","sudha","likitha","rupa"]
 print(student[2])
 output- likitha
 
 ex : name="ritu"
 print(name[1])
 outpiut- "i"       # in the both cases user get the specific letter or element
