ex 2: print("hello,"i am ritu"")
output:error because you are using so many commas so that it is not able to understand "WHAT IS BEGINNING AND WHAT IS ENDING"
error correction:print('hello,"i am ritu"')
output:hello,i am ritu

ex 3:print('hello,"you're so beautiful"')
output:error because i this case also it is not able to understand that "WHAT IS BEGINNIG AND ENDINNG OF THE STATEMENT"
error correction:print('hello,"you\'re so beautiful"')
