IN DATATYPE SOME MINUTE IMPORTANT POINTS ARE

1.  To know about the type of the value we use the syntax as type();
    ex : a=5;
    print(type(a))
    output is <int>

2. addition of one int and one float gives the answer in float like 2+9.0 gives float number as 11.00 


3. we can convert any datatype of any value to the required one 

ex : a=5.0;
print(int(a));      OR

ex : a=int(5.0);
print(a);

output is as - 5 #which is int so in this way float is converted into int such as a=5.0 to a=5.

#we can check whether the given statment is true or false in print function itself in case of boolean and comparison operators as follows
ex : 1. physics marks=45;
print(physics>35);
output: true       #it is based on comparison operators 

ex :2. rent=1500;
print(rent>1000 and rent<2000)

output : true   #it is based on conditional operators

therefore in this way by we can check the given statement is true of false in print function itself(comparison operators and boolean or conditional operators)
